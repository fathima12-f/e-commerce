    "Fine-tuning" refers to making small, precise changes to improve the site's:

Design/layout (e.g. spacing, alignment, responsiveness)

Functionality (e.g. fixing small bugs, improving performance)

Content (e.g. typos, formatting, clarity)

User experience (e.g. navigation flow, page speed, accessibility)

It usually comes after the major development is done and before the final delivery or launch of the site.

Example in context:

If a developer has built most of the site but there are still small tweaks needed — like adjusting the font size, fixing hover effects, or replacing placeholder images — someone might say:

"Please finish fine-tuning of the site before we go live."
