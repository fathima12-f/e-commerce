<p>  
  âœ¨ Happy Birthday, my love! âœ¨

You are someone I can never forget in my life.

Dee, I love you. I know we canâ€™t be together anymore, but I truly wished to make you mine. It didnâ€™t happenâ€¦ and maybe it never will. Still, Iâ€™m sure I will never find anyone like you again in my life. You are so special to me.

Every night I cry remembering everything â€” not a single night has passed without it. I donâ€™t even know why I cry like this, but I just canâ€™t stop it. Until today, I have never shared this with anyone.

Iâ€™m not saying this to make you sad â€” I just felt like telling you. Iâ€™m sorry if it hurt you.

Dee, I love youâ€¦ but more than that, what I truly wish for is that you always stay happy.

ðŸ’– HappyÂ BirthdayÂ ðŸ’–
