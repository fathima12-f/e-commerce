  ✨ Happy Birthday, my love! ✨

You are someone I can never forget in my life.

Dee, I love you. I know we can’t be together anymore, but I truly wished to make you mine. It didn’t happen… and maybe it never will. Still, I’m sure I will never find anyone like you again in my life. You are so special to me.

Every night I cry remembering everything — not a single night has passed without it. I don’t even know why I cry like this, but I just can’t stop it. Until today, I have never shared this with anyone.

I’m not saying this to make you sad — I just felt like telling you. I’m sorry if it hurt you.

Dee, I love you… but more than that, what I truly wish for is that you always stay happy.

💖 Happy Birthday 💖
